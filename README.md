## Project Overview
Accurately predicting the calories burned during physical activity is crucial for understanding energy expenditure, managing weight, and optimizing exercise routines. This project leverages machine learning techniques to build a model that predicts calories burned using data from two datasets that include user characteristics and exercise metrics.

## Dataset Description
We are working with two datasets that provide detailed information on users' physical attributes and exercise metrics. The first dataset contains information about users during their exercise sessions, while the second dataset includes the target variable, which represents the number of calories burned.

## Features
The dataset contains the following features:

Exercise Data
User_ID: Unique identifier for each user.
Gender: Gender of the user (Male/Female).
Age: Age of the user (in years).
Height: Height of the user (in cm).
Weight: Weight of the user (in kg).
Duration: Duration of the exercise (in minutes).
Heart_Rate: Average heart rate during the exercise (in bpm).
Body_Temp: Body temperature during the exercise (in °C).

Calories Data
User_ID: Unique identifier for each user.
Gender: Gender of the user (Male/Female).
Age: Age of the user (in years).
Height: Height of the user (in cm).
Weight: Weight of the user (in kg).
Duration: Duration of the exercise (in minutes).
Heart_Rate: Average heart rate during the exercise (in bpm).
Body_Temp: Body temperature during the exercise (in °C).
Calories: The number of calories burned during the exercise session.

## Modeling
The project involves training a machine learning model using the features listed above to predict the target variable, which is the number of calories burned. Various algorithms can be explored, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and more. The performance of the models will be evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error, R-squared, and others.
